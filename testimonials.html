                    <p>"Megan was a pleasure to work with from beginning to end of the animation process.  She brought excellent ideas and easily incorporated my ideas for the animation into her work.  I would highly recommend her work as her art is fun, engaging and she has an eye for placement and color.  We will work together again I hope."

                    <p>"Megan was a pleasure to work with from beginning to end of the animation process.  She brought excellent ideas and easily incorporated my ideas for the animation into her work.  I would highly recommend her work as her art is fun, engaging and she has an eye for placement and color.  We will work together again I hope."

                    <p>"I can't recommend Megan enough. Not only was she a breeze to communicate and share ideas with, she added creative touches to the project that lifted it far above my expectations. Add to that her ability to get high quality work done on time and under budget (a dream combination) she took each project seriously, providing a sense of trust and care that made it easy to give her feedback and trust her with final results. We will definitely work together again."
